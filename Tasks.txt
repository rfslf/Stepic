251 LCD-calculator
Given a sequence of digits, write a program, which outputs these digits in the style of an LCD-calculator (see example).
The size of all digits is 4 symbols in width and 7 symbols in height. There should be one empty column between the
digits in the output. There should be no spaces before the first digit. Digits in the output should be framed, corners
of this frame should contain the x symbols, a horizontal line if created by the - symbol ("hyphen"), and the vertical
one -- by the vertical line symbol: |.

252 Derivative of the polynomial
The problem is simple – find the derivative of the polynomial. The polynomial can be large, but only with non-negative
integral powers and integer coefficients. Think about how it is better to represent it in the memory? The output should
contain no spaces and be in the descending order of powers, although the input may not comply with this rule.
Additionally, the input may contain a polynomial with unreduced terms.

259 Phoebe Iterson
In this problem, you have to write the fibonacci_sequence class, from which we can take the iterator, which will sort
numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

260 Implementation of the multifilter class
Class filter is one of the most frequently used classes in Python. In the constructor it takes the two arguments a and f
– a sequence and a function, and allows to iterate only by such elements x from the sequence a that f(x) equals to True.
Let’s say that in this case the function f accepts the element x, and the element x is an accepted one.
In this problem, we ask you to implement the multifilter class, which will do the same as the standard filter class, but
will use several functions instead of a single one. The decision to accept an element will be taken based on how many
functions accept  this element, and how many don't. Let us mark these quantities as pos and neg. Let us introduce the
notion of the decision function – this is the function, which takes the two arguments – numbers pos and neg, and returns
True, if the element is allowed, and False otherwise.

261 Work with the API 2

264 The shortest distance
Find the shortest distance between the two local maximums of the sequence of natural numbers, ending with the number 0.
The number 0 itself is not included into the sequence and serves as a sign of its end. If there are no two local
maximums in the sequence, output 0. The start and the end value are not considered as a local maximums.

265 Strict local maximums
The element of a sequence is called a local maximum, if it is strictly greater than the previous and the subsequent
element of the sequence. The first and the last elements of the sequence are not the local maximum. Given the sequence

physics, and informatics). The numbers in the line are separated by a single space. The grades shall take the value from
1 to 5. You need to output the surname-name pairs on a single line, separating surname and name by a single space. You
don't need to output marks. If several students have the same average grade, you need to output them in the order
specified in the input data.

Given the integer 1≤n≤107, you need to find the last digit of the n-th Fibonacci number. As we remember, Fibonacci
numbers grow very quickly, therefore you should be extremely careful when calculating them. In this problem, however,
we can evade this issue, because we are interested only in the last digit of the Fibonacci number: if 0≤a,b≤9
— the digits of numbers Fi and Fi+1 correspondingly, than (a+b)mod10 — the last digit of the number Fi+2.
For each of the entered number N, find the number of integers from 1 to N, relatively prime (coprime) to N.

elements in the list, the last element remains at its position.

283 Shift
In this problem, you need to implement the function, which shifts the contents of the array to the left for a specified
number of positions (circular shift). On input, the function takes the array, its size and the value of the shift. For
example, if on input the function receives the array: a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]; and you need to circularly shift it 2
positions to the left, on the output we will get the numbers in the following order: 3, 4, 5, 1, 2.
Note that the value of the shift may be zero, and may be larger than the size of the array; please take into account
all these cases.

Given three strings – s, a, b, which consist of lowercase Latin letters. In one operation you may replace all
occurrences of the substring a in the string s to the string b. For example, s = "abab", a = "ab", b = "ba", then after
performing one operation the string s goes to the string "baba", after performing two operations – to the string "bbaa",
and all further operation will not alter the string s. You need to find out after how many operations there will be no
occurrences of string a in the string s, or to find out that this will not happen. Output a single number – the number
of operations after which there will be no occurrences of the string a in the string s.

If after performing any number of operation there still will be occurrences of the string a in the string s, output Impossible.

there is a tag <a href="B">, possibly with additional parameters inside the tag. From A we can go to B in two steps,
if there is such document C, that from A to C we can go in one step, and from C to B we can go in one step.
On input your program gets two lines, containing the URLs to the two documents A and B. Output Yes, if you can go from
A to B for two steps, otherwise output No.
Please note that not all links inside the HTML pages can lead to an existing HTML pages.

<a ... href="..." ... > inside it, and output a list of websites to which there is a link. In this problem a website –
is a domain name with all subdomains. I.e., this is a sequence of symbols, which follows right after the protocol
symbols, if any, up to the symbols of port or path, if any, excluding the cases with relative links in the form
<a href="../some_path/index.html">. Please output websites in the alphabetical order.

325 Message encoding
We will be dealing with a trivial example of message encoding, where the mapping of original symbols to the "code" is
simply taking the ASCII value of the symbol. For example, the "code" version of the letter 'A' would be 65.
You will be given as input a string of any length consisting of any possible ASCII characters. You must print out the
numerical ASCII value of each character of the string, separated by spaces.

326 Encode the message

328 ASCII table
Implement the program that returns the letter, which stands after the "\" (backslash) symbol in the ASCII table by a
given distance N.

329 Assigments
In this problem Python code is served as input. Your task is to find all the assignments in the code and to output where
hey occurred, and the value of what variable they changed! Please remember that according to the PEP8 standard, the
operation of assignment (in contrast to the transfer of an argument) is separated by a single space from both sides.
Thus, as a valid assignment we consider if (something, consisting of only letters, numbers and lowerspace)=(something).
In this problem we believe that there may be only one assignment of only one variable per line.
For each assignment you need to output on a separate line – the line number (lines are numbered from one) and the name
of the variable, value of which has been changed. The line numbers must be in ascending order.

CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which
case you may return any one.)

333 The Longest Repeat Problem
Although the suffix tree decreases memory requirements from O(|Text|2) to O(|Text|), on average it still requires about
20 times as much memory as Text. In the case of a 3 GB human genome, 60 GB of RAM is a huge improvement over the 1 TB
that we needed to work with Trie(Patterns), but it still presents a memory challenge for most machines. This reveals a
dark secret of big-O notation, which is that it ignores constant factors. For long strings such as the human genome,
we will need to pay attention to this constant factor, since the expression O(|Text|) applies to both an algorithm with
2 · |Text| memory and an algorithm with 1000 · |Text| memory.
Yet before seeing how we can further reduce the memory needed for multiple pattern matching, we ask you to solve three
problems showing how suffix trees can be applied to other pattern matching challenges. The first such problem is the
Longest Repeat Problem.
Longest Repeat Problem: Find the longest repeat in a string.
Input: A string Text.
Output: A longest substring of Text that appears in Text more than once.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Longest Repeat Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which case you may
return any one.)

338 Final amount of loan
Write a simple Python program that calculates the final amount of your loan that earns compound interest, given the
principal amount, the annual nominal interest rate, the number of times interested is compounded per year, and the
number of years. If P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual nominal interest rate, n is the
number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years, the total amount paid is
A=P(1+rn)nt
Amount owed is the principal amount multiplied by the amount one plus the annual nominal interest rate divided by n
raised to the number of times compounded multiplied by the number of years. (exponentiation)
Careful! The rules of precedence really matter in the student loan calculator problem.

from which you need to read data. Your task is to calculate the vector of the coefficients of the linear regression for
he prediction of the first variable (the first column of data) by all the rest. Please remember that linear regression
model is y=β0+β1x1+⋯+βnxn. Print the coefficients of the linear regression, starting with β0, space separated.
We will verify the match with an accuracy of up to 4 digits after the decimal point.

Each command is specified as 2 integer numbers: a b.
a = 1 - push front,
a = 2 - pop front,
a = 3 - push back,
a = 4 - pop back.
If given command is pop, then the number b is expected value. If the pop command is called for an empty deque, then “-1”
is expected. You should output YES if all the expected values matched. Otherwise, if at least one expectation was not
met, then output NO.

respectively) as well as the determinacy coefficient between them. Output three float numbers in the following order:
a coefficient, b coefficient, determency coefficient. Separete the numbers by spaces. All problems allow to make a
default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated. It is enough to use 4 digits after the point.
