326 Encode the message
We have the following symbol mappings: A ↔ 00 C ↔ 01 G ↔ 10 T ↔ 11
Given a string of A's, C's, G's, and T's, encode the message via the above mapping and print out the resulting encoded
message to standard output.

327 Decode the message
We have the following symbol mappings: A ↔ 00 C ↔ 01 G ↔ 10 T ↔ 11
Given a string of 0's and 1's, decode the message via the above mapping and print out the resulting decoded message to
standard output.

328 ASCII table
Implement the program that returns the letter, which stands after the "\" (backslash) symbol in the ASCII table by a
given distance N.

329 Assigments
In this problem Python code is served as input. Your task is to find all the assignments in the code and to output where
hey occurred, and the value of what variable they changed! Please remember that according to the PEP8 standard, the
operation of assignment (in contrast to the transfer of an argument) is separated by a single space from both sides.
Thus, as a valid assignment we consider if (something, consisting of only letters, numbers and lowerspace)=(something).
In this problem we believe that there may be only one assignment of only one variable per line.
For each assignment you need to output on a separate line – the line number (lines are numbered from one) and the name
of the variable, value of which has been changed. The line numbers must be in ascending order.

330 Remove all whitespace
Jack doesn't like when Amy puts spaces before punctuation marks, but Amy cannot possibly get rid of this habit! Help Amy
construct a regular expression, which will remove all whitespace characters before punctuation marks, not to freak out.

331 Smiley face
You need to check whether the string is a smiley face. If yes – output 1, otherwise – 0.
Smiley:
Eyes is one of ":" ";"  ">:",
nose "-" either one or none at all,
mouth is one of "{", "}", "[", "]", "(", ")", "p" at least once. One type may be repeated as many times as you want.
All symbols go precisely in the listed order, smiley does not contain any other symbols.

332 The Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem
Finally, we ask you to solve the Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem. Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem:
Find the shortest substring of one string that does not appear in another string.
Input: Strings Text1 and Text2.
Output: The shortest substring of Text1 that does not appear in Text2.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which
case you may return any one.)

333 The Longest Repeat Problem
Although the suffix tree decreases memory requirements from O(|Text|2) to O(|Text|), on average it still requires about
20 times as much memory as Text. In the case of a 3 GB human genome, 60 GB of RAM is a huge improvement over the 1 TB
that we needed to work with Trie(Patterns), but it still presents a memory challenge for most machines. This reveals a
dark secret of big-O notation, which is that it ignores constant factors. For long strings such as the human genome,
we will need to pay attention to this constant factor, since the expression O(|Text|) applies to both an algorithm with
2 · |Text| memory and an algorithm with 1000 · |Text| memory.
Yet before seeing how we can further reduce the memory needed for multiple pattern matching, we ask you to solve three
problems showing how suffix trees can be applied to other pattern matching challenges. The first such problem is the
Longest Repeat Problem.
Longest Repeat Problem: Find the longest repeat in a string.
Input: A string Text.
Output: A longest substring of Text that appears in Text more than once.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Longest Repeat Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which case you may
return any one.)

334 The Longest Shared Substring Problem
The second additional exercise that we will consider is the Longest Shared Substring Problem. Longest Shared Substring
Problem: Find the longest substring shared by two strings.
Input: Strings Text1 and Text2.
Output: The longest substring that occurs in both Text1 and Text2.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Longest Shared Substring Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist,
 n which case you may return any one.)

335 Surface area
Given the four real (x,y) coordinates of a square A1A2A3A4, find its surface area.

336 Converting Fahrenheit to Celsius
Write a Python program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. C=5/9(F−32)

337 True or False?
A user enters two float numbers. Let's assume these are A and B. Print whether the following is true: A × B > A / B.
It is guaranteed that the second number (B) isn't zero. Your program should simply print "True" or "False".

338 Final amount of loan
Write a simple Python program that calculates the final amount of your loan that earns compound interest, given the
principal amount, the annual nominal interest rate, the number of times interested is compounded per year, and the
number of years. If P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual nominal interest rate, n is the
number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years, the total amount paid is
A=P(1+rn)nt
Amount owed is the principal amount multiplied by the amount one plus the annual nominal interest rate divided by n
raised to the number of times compounded multiplied by the number of years. (exponentiation)
Careful! The rules of precedence really matter in the student loan calculator problem.

339 Square of the hypotenuse
Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000. Write the integer corresponding to the square of the
hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b. Do not write Python code as an output, just a single
integer.

340 Karatsuba algorithm
Given two long integers 1≤x,y≤1050000 in decimal, output their product xy. Please note that some programming languages
(like Haskell, Python, Java) provide long arithmetic out of the box. Please do not use built-in functions,
but implement your own procedure.

341 Linear regression
Find the optimal coefficients to construct a linear regression. On input your program will get the name of the csv-file,
from which you need to read data. Your task is to calculate the vector of the coefficients of the linear regression for
he prediction of the first variable (the first column of data) by all the rest. Please remember that linear regression
model is y=β0+β1x1+⋯+βnxn. Print the coefficients of the linear regression, starting with β0, space separated.
We will verify the match with an accuracy of up to 4 digits after the decimal point.

342 Deque
Implement the deque with dynamic looped buffer. Commands are given as input in order to test the deque.
The first line contains the number of commands. Then each line contains one command.
Each command is specified as 2 integer numbers: a b.
a = 1 - push front,
a = 2 - pop front,
a = 3 - push back,
a = 4 - pop back.
If given command is pop, then the number b is expected value. If the pop command is called for an empty deque, then “-1”
is expected. You should output YES if all the expected values matched. Otherwise, if at least one expectation was not
met, then output NO.

343 Bracket sequence
Given a fragment of the bracket sequence, consisting of the symbols (){}[].
You need to find whether it is possible to continue this fragment to both sides to obtain the correct bracket sequence.
If it is possible – output the minimum correct bracket sequence, otherwise output "IMPOSSIBLE".
The maximum length of the string is 106 symbols.

344 How many numbers?
The first line contains the integer N (1≤N≤105). Next specified the array of integers from −109 to 109. Further goes
the number of requests K (1≤K≤105), next go K pairs of requests L, R  (−109≤L≤R≤109).You need to output the K numbers,
which are the responses to the requests "How many numbers in the array are located on the range from L to R?".

345 Histogram
At your individual Iris dataset take “Sepal length” (the first column) feature and find the histogram with 10 bins
(left-open intervals). Put the array of frequencies at the bins in the order of bins as your output.

346 Linear regression
Find the coefficients of linear regression Y = aX + b of the petal length Y and petal width X (features 3 and 4
respectively) as well as the determinacy coefficient between them. Output three float numbers in the following order:
a coefficient, b coefficient, determency coefficient. Separete the numbers by spaces. All problems allow to make a
default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated. It is enough to use 4 digits after the point.
