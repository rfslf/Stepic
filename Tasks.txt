301 Breakpoints in a permutation
Let  pn be a sequence of integer numbers.  If pi+1−pi is not equal to 1, then we say that (pi,pi+1) is a breakpoint.
Find the number of breakpoints in a permutation.

302 Spanish-Latin dictionary
Input data: The first line contains the only integer number N that is the number of Spanish words in the dictionary.
Then N descriptions follow: each of the descriptions is located in a separate line, where first goes a Spanish word,
next goes the space separated dash (symbol number 45), and then go the translations of this Spanish word into Latin,
separated by spaces and commas. Translations are sorted in the lexicographic order. The order of the Spanish words in
the dictionary is also lexicographic. All words consist of only the lowercase Latin letters; length of each word does
not exceed 15 characters. The total number of words at the input is not greater than 100000.
Output data: Output the Latin-Spanish dictionary, corresponding to the given one, strictly observing the format of the
input data. In particular, the first should be the translation of a lexicographically minimal Latin word, further - the
second in this order, etc. Spanish words inside the translation must also be sorted in a lexicographic order.

303 Turnpike Problem
Turnpike Problem: Given all pairwise distances between points on a line segment, reconstruct the positions of those
points.
Input: A collection of integers L.
Output: A set of integers A such that ∆A = L.

Given a sequence of lines. Output the lines, which contain the backslash "\".

306 Find a cat
Given a sequence of lines. Output all the lines, which contain "cat" as a word.

307 Swap letters
Given a sequence of lines. In each line swap the first two letters in every word, consisting of at least two letters.
A symbol from the group \w is considered a letter.

308 Two letters "z"
Given a sequence of lines. Output the lines, containing 2 letters "z" between which there are exactly three characters.

Given a sequence of lines. Output the lines, which contain the word, consisting of two identical parts (tandem repeat).

311 Replacement
Given a sequence of lines. In each line replace all occurrences of the substring "human" to the substring "computer"
and output the resulting lines.

312 Binary notation
Given a sequence of lines. Output the lines, containing the binary notation of a number, divisible by 3. Binary notation
of a number is its notation in the binary numbering system. This problem can be easily solved by reduction of the string
to an integer and verification of the remainder of division by three, but still, we ask you to solve it without using
reduction to a number. Try regular expressions.

313 Multiple identical letters
Given a sequence of lines. In each line replace all occurrences of multiple identical letters by one letter. A symbol
from the group \w is considered a letter.

314 Replacement - 3
Given a sequence of lines. In each line replace the first occurrence of the word, consisting of only the Latin letters
"a" (case insensitive), to the word "argh".

315 Pattern
In this problem, you get text as an input. By using regular expressions you need to find all occurrences of the "you"
substring in it and output their number. NB. In this problem, you should also consider the case of letters.

316 Re-occurrence of a symbol
Given the list of phone numbers (each line contains one phone number). Your task is to check whether these phone numbers
are "cool": a phone number is called "cool", if it contains 3 or more same digits in a row. For example, number
19992034050 is a "cool" one, but 19500237492 is not.

317 Sets of symbols
In this problem, you get text on input. By using regular expressions you need to find all the occurrences of the "you"
or "You" substring in it and output their quantity.

318 Assignments - 2
Python code is given on input; there may be only one assignment per line, but with several variables. It is necessary to
find all uncommented assignments and for each such assignment output a space separated line number and name of each
variable (in the same order they are in the assignment).

319 Namespace
Implement a program that will simulate the work with namespaces. It is necessary to implement the support for the
creation of namespaces and adding variables into them.
In this problem, each of the namespaces has its unique text identifier - its name.
On input, your program is served the following requests:
create <namespace> <parent> –  create the new namespace with the name <namespace> inside the space <parent>
add <namespace> <var> – add the <var> variable to the namespace <namespace>
get <namespace> <var> – get the name of the namespace, from which the <var> will be taken during the request from the
<namespace>, or None, if such namespace does not exist

320 JSON format
You are given a description of the class inheritance in the JSON format.
The description represents an array of JSON objects that match the classes. Each JSON-object has the name field, which
contains the name of the class, and the parents field, which contains the list of names of the direct ancestors.

321 Using standard library
Download a JSON file and find sum of all foos. Foos are always integers.

322 XML format
You are given a description of a pyramid made of cubes in the XML format. The cubes can be of three colors: red (red),
green (green) and blue (blue). We know the color of each cube, and the cubes, located directly under it.

323 HTML-pages
There are two HTML-pages – A and B. From A we can go to B in one step, if inside A there is a link to B, i.e. inside A
there is a tag <a href="B">, possibly with additional parameters inside the tag. From A we can go to B in two steps,
if there is such document C, that from A to C we can go in one step, and from C to B we can go in one step.
On input your program gets two lines, containing the URLs to the two documents A and B. Output Yes, if you can go from
A to B for two steps, otherwise output No.
Please note that not all links inside the HTML pages can lead to an existing HTML pages.

324 HTML-file
Your program gets a link to an HTML-file as input.You need to download this file, and then find all links in a form
<a ... href="..." ... > inside it, and output a list of websites to which there is a link. In this problem a website –
is a domain name with all subdomains. I.e., this is a sequence of symbols, which follows right after the protocol
symbols, if any, up to the symbols of port or path, if any, excluding the cases with relative links in the form
<a href="../some_path/index.html">. Please output websites in the alphabetical order.

325 Message encoding
We will be dealing with a trivial example of message encoding, where the mapping of original symbols to the "code" is
simply taking the ASCII value of the symbol. For example, the "code" version of the letter 'A' would be 65.
You will be given as input a string of any length consisting of any possible ASCII characters. You must print out the
numerical ASCII value of each character of the string, separated by spaces.

326 Encode the message
We have the following symbol mappings: A ↔ 00 C ↔ 01 G ↔ 10 T ↔ 11
Given a string of A's, C's, G's, and T's, encode the message via the above mapping and print out the resulting encoded
message to standard output.

327 Decode the message
We have the following symbol mappings: A ↔ 00 C ↔ 01 G ↔ 10 T ↔ 11
Given a string of 0's and 1's, decode the message via the above mapping and print out the resulting decoded message to
standard output.

328 ASCII table
Implement the program that returns the letter, which stands after the "\" (backslash) symbol in the ASCII table by a
given distance N.

329 Assigments
In this problem Python code is served as input. Your task is to find all the assignments in the code and to output where
hey occurred, and the value of what variable they changed! Please remember that according to the PEP8 standard, the
operation of assignment (in contrast to the transfer of an argument) is separated by a single space from both sides.
Thus, as a valid assignment we consider if (something, consisting of only letters, numbers and lowerspace)=(something).
In this problem we believe that there may be only one assignment of only one variable per line.
For each assignment you need to output on a separate line – the line number (lines are numbered from one) and the name
of the variable, value of which has been changed. The line numbers must be in ascending order.

330 Remove all whitespace
Jack doesn't like when Amy puts spaces before punctuation marks, but Amy cannot possibly get rid of this habit! Help Amy
construct a regular expression, which will remove all whitespace characters before punctuation marks, not to freak out.

331 Smiley face
You need to check whether the string is a smiley face. If yes – output 1, otherwise – 0.
Smiley:
Eyes is one of ":" ";"  ">:",
nose "-" either one or none at all,
mouth is one of "{", "}", "[", "]", "(", ")", "p" at least once. One type may be repeated as many times as you want.
All symbols go precisely in the listed order, smiley does not contain any other symbols.

332 The Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem
Finally, we ask you to solve the Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem. Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem:
Find the shortest substring of one string that does not appear in another string.
Input: Strings Text1 and Text2.
Output: The shortest substring of Text1 that does not appear in Text2.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Shortest Non-Shared Substring Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which
case you may return any one.)

333 The Longest Repeat Problem
Although the suffix tree decreases memory requirements from O(|Text|2) to O(|Text|), on average it still requires about
20 times as much memory as Text. In the case of a 3 GB human genome, 60 GB of RAM is a huge improvement over the 1 TB
that we needed to work with Trie(Patterns), but it still presents a memory challenge for most machines. This reveals a
dark secret of big-O notation, which is that it ignores constant factors. For long strings such as the human genome,
we will need to pay attention to this constant factor, since the expression O(|Text|) applies to both an algorithm with
2 · |Text| memory and an algorithm with 1000 · |Text| memory.
Yet before seeing how we can further reduce the memory needed for multiple pattern matching, we ask you to solve three
problems showing how suffix trees can be applied to other pattern matching challenges. The first such problem is the
Longest Repeat Problem.
Longest Repeat Problem: Find the longest repeat in a string.
Input: A string Text.
Output: A longest substring of Text that appears in Text more than once.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Longest Repeat Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist, in which case you may
return any one.)

334 The Longest Shared Substring Problem
The second additional exercise that we will consider is the Longest Shared Substring Problem. Longest Shared Substring
Problem: Find the longest substring shared by two strings.
Input: Strings Text1 and Text2.
Output: The longest substring that occurs in both Text1 and Text2.
CODE CHALLENGE (Extra Credit!): Solve the Longest Shared Substring Problem. (Multiple solutions may exist,
 n which case you may return any one.)

337 True or False?
A user enters two float numbers. Let's assume these are A and B. Print whether the following is true: A × B > A / B.
It is guaranteed that the second number (B) isn't zero. Your program should simply print "True" or "False".

338 Final amount of loan
Write a simple Python program that calculates the final amount of your loan that earns compound interest, given the
principal amount, the annual nominal interest rate, the number of times interested is compounded per year, and the
number of years. If P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual nominal interest rate, n is the
number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years, the total amount paid is
A=P(1+rn)nt
Amount owed is the principal amount multiplied by the amount one plus the annual nominal interest rate divided by n
raised to the number of times compounded multiplied by the number of years. (exponentiation)
Careful! The rules of precedence really matter in the student loan calculator problem.

339 Square of the hypotenuse
Given: Two positive integers a and b, each less than 1000. Write the integer corresponding to the square of the
hypotenuse of the right triangle whose legs have lengths a and b. Do not write Python code as an output, just a single
integer.

340 Karatsuba algorithm
Given two long integers 1≤x,y≤1050000 in decimal, output their product xy. Please note that some programming languages
(like Haskell, Python, Java) provide long arithmetic out of the box. Please do not use built-in functions,
but implement your own procedure.

341 Linear regression
Find the optimal coefficients to construct a linear regression. On input your program will get the name of the csv-file,
from which you need to read data. Your task is to calculate the vector of the coefficients of the linear regression for
he prediction of the first variable (the first column of data) by all the rest. Please remember that linear regression
model is y=β0+β1x1+⋯+βnxn. Print the coefficients of the linear regression, starting with β0, space separated.
We will verify the match with an accuracy of up to 4 digits after the decimal point.

342 Deque
Implement the deque with dynamic looped buffer. Commands are given as input in order to test the deque.
The first line contains the number of commands. Then each line contains one command.
Each command is specified as 2 integer numbers: a b.
a = 1 - push front,
a = 2 - pop front,
a = 3 - push back,
a = 4 - pop back.
If given command is pop, then the number b is expected value. If the pop command is called for an empty deque, then “-1”
is expected. You should output YES if all the expected values matched. Otherwise, if at least one expectation was not
met, then output NO.

343 Bracket sequence
Given a fragment of the bracket sequence, consisting of the symbols (){}[].
You need to find whether it is possible to continue this fragment to both sides to obtain the correct bracket sequence.
If it is possible – output the minimum correct bracket sequence, otherwise output "IMPOSSIBLE".
The maximum length of the string is 106 symbols.

344 How many numbers?
The first line contains the integer N (1≤N≤105). Next specified the array of integers from −109 to 109. Further goes
the number of requests K (1≤K≤105), next go K pairs of requests L, R  (−109≤L≤R≤109).You need to output the K numbers,
which are the responses to the requests "How many numbers in the array are located on the range from L to R?".

respectively) as well as the determinacy coefficient between them. Output three float numbers in the following order:
a coefficient, b coefficient, determency coefficient. Separete the numbers by spaces. All problems allow to make a
default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated. It is enough to use 4 digits after the point.
